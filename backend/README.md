# Meeting Room Booking System

## Project Structure Analysis & Fixes Applied

### Entity Relationships ✅
- **No circular dependencies detected** - Relationships are properly structured
- **User (AppUser)** → One-to-Many with Bookings (as Organizer) and Attendees
- **MeetingRoom** → One-to-Many with Bookings
- **Booking** → Many-to-One with User and MeetingRoom, One-to-Many with Attendees
- **Attendee** → Many-to-One with User and Booking

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. Program.cs Configuration
- ✅ Removed duplicate Identity registration
- ✅ Added missing `UseAuthentication()` middleware
- ✅ Proper service registration order

#### 2. Entity Improvements
- ✅ Added null-forgiving operator to `Booking.Title` property
- ✅ Enhanced exception classes with standard constructors

#### 3. Service Layer Enhancements
- ✅ Added null validation for DTO parameters
- ✅ Optimized AutoMapper usage in services
- ✅ Removed unnecessary database calls

#### 4. Repository Layer Improvements
- ✅ Made `IRepository<T>` generic with key type `IRepository<T, TKey>`
- ✅ Added thread safety with lock mechanisms
- ✅ Optimized delete operations using `RemoveAll`
- ✅ Enhanced thread-safe operations

#### 5. AppDbContext Configuration
The current configuration is correct with:
- Proper foreign key relationships
- `DeleteBehavior.Restrict` to prevent cascade delete issues
- String length constraints for performance

### Remaining Security Considerations
- Consider adding CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Add input validation attributes to DTOs
- Update vulnerable packages when possible
- Implement proper logging sanitization

### Performance Optimizations Applied
- Thread-safe repository operations
- Optimized LINQ operations
- Removed redundant database calls
- Enhanced AutoMapper configurations

The project structure is now more robust with proper relationships, thread safety, and optimized performance.
